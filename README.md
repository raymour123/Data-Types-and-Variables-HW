## Homework

#### Requirements

- Copy Main.java from this repository into an IntelliJ project
- Complete the code in Main.java based on the instructions in the comments
- Save your IntelliJ project; tomorrow we'll learn to submit via github

#### Starter code

The starter code is in `Main.java`. Click on that file above and copy the code to your IntelliJ project, like you did during the exercise in clas.

#### Deliverable

Tomorrow we'll learn how to _fork_ the repository, _clone_ it to your computer,  _commit_ your changes, _push_ your commits to github, then finally submit a _pull request_ to send your code to us. For now, just save your code and remember where it is :)
